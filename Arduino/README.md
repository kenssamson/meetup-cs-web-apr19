# Arduino Sample - Adafruit AdaBox002 Rover Project

This is a modified version of the Adafruit Rover Project.  The schematic folder includes a fritzing file and image of the modifications made to the Rover.  These include:

* Head and Tail lights
* Thermosister to read the temperature
* Photo Light Sensor that can be used to automatically turn on/off lights
* Piezzo Buzzer to play some music

This code example requires the Arduino IDE to build and deploy the sketch which can be downloaded from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software.  If you are running Windows, it is recommended you install the classic desktop applilcation and not the Windows app.  It is also recommend to the run the installer software for at least the first time installing.  This will install the necessary USB/COM drivers required to communicate with the board.

There is a Visual Studio Code extension available for building Arduino sketches. It is currently in beta and it still requires you install the Arduino IDE software.  To learn more about the extension and how to install it, please visit https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.vscode-arduino

This code example also requires the for following Arduino libraries:

* Adafruit BluefruitLE nRF51 Library
* Adafruit Motor Shield V2 Library
* Arduino toneAC Library - https://bitbucket.org/teckel12/arduino-toneac/wiki/Home

The **Adafruit** libraries are available from the Library Manager which is installed as part of the Arduino IDE.  Instructions on using the library manager can be found on the Adafruit website at the following address: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-all-about-arduino-libraries-install-use/library-manager

The toneAC library must be installed manually.  There are instructions on the website.

To view the schematic file, you will need a copy of the Fritzing application which can be downloaded from http://fritzing.org/download/
